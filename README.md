## Usage

 This project will allow the user to have a back end that tracks/processes requests and provides responses (JSON) for an ecommerce business

 - The user will be able to view products, categories, and tags
 - The user will be able to add, delete, and update most tables (information) of the ecommerce database

 - (FUTURE DEV) - Many other options can be added to further access/add/remove/update
 - (FUTURE DEV) - This app has little to no error control implemented at this point with respect to user input (short of SQL defaults)
